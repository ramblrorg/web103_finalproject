## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

During this unit, the team collaboration went well. Due to the limited time we had before our upcoming demo day, we were very proactive in communicating our completed tickets, pull requests and giving feedback to ensure they were being completed in a timely manner. We also decided on what tickets were essential features to our project functionality to ensure we stayed on track and kept progress. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Although the backend was mostly finished, we still had the frontend left to develop within a very short span of time. Connecting the backend to a functional frontend while balancing everyone's workload and schedules was challenging. We also had to troubleshoot integration issues between the client and server, which required frequent communication and collaboration to resolve quickly.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

We're proud of the progress we were able to make despite the roadblocks we encountered and how our project has come together so far. It was rewarding to see the different pieces of the application integrate successfully, from the database and API endpoints to the user interface. 

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

Since the beginning of the course, we have become more confident in the process of building a full-stack web application. We've learned how to develop backend applications using Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, and how to connect them to a functional frontend. Through this capstone, we have learned a lot about GitHub projects, issues, milestones, communications, and collaborating on a repo without git conflicts. Overall, our confidence has increased in our technical abilities and in our ability to work as an effective team on a larger project.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

Looking ahead, we would like to continue our journey in developing full-stack development skills by building more personal projects. We want to further understand backend architecture, testing and deployment to build professional, scalable projects. We will also use these skills to search for internship and full time work opportunities in the field.
